            You can push files to GitHub directly from VS Code without using the terminal by utilizing the built-in Git UI. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:
        1. Initialize Git in Your Project (if not done already):
        Open your project folder in VS Code.
        If your project is not already a Git repository,
    </p><p class="b"> you can initialize it from the Git panel.
        Open the Source Control panel by clicking the Git icon on the left sidebar or using the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + G (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + G (Mac).
        Click Initialize Repository to set up a Git repository in your folder.
        2. Connect to a GitHub Repository:
        If your project is already a Git repository, you'll need to connect it to a remote GitHub repository.
        
        Click the Source Control icon and look for three dots (...) at the top of the Source Control panel.
        Click on ... -> Remote -> Add Remote.
        Enter the GitHub repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git).
        3. Stage Your Changes:</p><p class="c">
            In the Source Control panel, you will see your modified or new files listed under Changes.
            Hover over the file(s) and click the plus (+) icon to stage the changes, or click Stage All Changes to stage all modified files.
            4. Commit Your Changes:
            After staging your changes, you'll see them listed under Staged Changes.
        Enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control panel and press Enter or click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.
        5. Push Your Changes to GitHub:
        After committing, you will see an up arrow or sync icon at the bottom left of the VS Code window (this represents the Git status).
        Click the up arrow (Push) to send your committed changes to the remote GitHub repository.
        6. Sync if Necessary:</p>
